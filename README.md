# Metoprolol-Model
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling of Metoprolol and its CYP2D6 Drug-Gene Interactions (DGIs)
## Repository Files 
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of metoprolol, its enantiomers and its metabolite α-hydroxymetoprolol. 
The model has been carefully developed and evaluated for the prediction of (*R*)-metoprolol, (*S*)-metoprolol, racemic metoprolol and metabolite α-hydroxymetoprolol plasma concentrations after intravenous and oral administration over a wide dose range (5 to 200 mg).

The PBPK model was developed to describe the effect of genetic variants in the *CYP2D6* gene on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol.
For this purpose, CYP2D6 k<sub>cat</sub> values were optimized for different CYP2D6 activity scores.

For further details on model development and evaluation as well as extensive documentation of the modeling process, please refer to [[1]](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/12/1200).
